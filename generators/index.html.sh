        <h3><a href="">ARM Support and New ISOs</a><d>03 Mar 2014</d></h3>
        <hr>
        BlackArch now has ARM support. Currently, there are 570 tools in the
        armv6h repo and 580 tools in the armv7h repo. We are working to close
        the gap between the ARM repos and the x86_64 and i686 repos. Expect to
        see over 600 tools in each ARM repo within a week or two.
        <br />
        <br />
		    Soon, we will release ARM images for various devices including the
		    Raspberry Pi and Pandaboard.
        <br />
        <br />
        We also released new ISOs today. The new ISOs make the following
        changes:
        <ul>
        <li>- package: added zathura</li>

        <li>- disabled pc speaker beep</li>

		establish network connections with the option to spoof MAC addresses,
		hostnames, clientids, etc.
        <br />
        <br />
		Also, we simplified the <a
		href="http://blackarch.org/download.html">installation instructions</a>
		with a new script: strap.sh.
        <br />

        <h3><a href="">New keyring</a><d>1 Jan 2014</d></h3>

            <li>- Support for i686 and x86_64 architectures</li>

            <li>- Modular package groups</li>
            <li>- A live ISO with multiple window managers, including dwm, Fluxbox, Openbox,
                Awesome, wmii, i3, and Spectrwm.</li>
            <li>- An installer with the ability to build from source.</li>
        </ul><br />
        <p><b>Soon we will release:</b></p>

            <li>- Documentation for all tools</li>

            <a href="https://github.com/BlackArch/sploitctl/blob/master/sploitctl.sh">sploitctl</a>.
        <a href="http://nullsecurity.net/">Nullsecurity</a> is an official supporter of BlackArch Linux.
        We have a relaxed development structure. We welcome pull requests of all sizes

        <h3><a href="">Major release and site redesign!</a><d>28 Dec 2013</d></h3>
        <hr>
        <p>We redesigned our website. We hope you like the new style.</p>
        <p>We also released a bunch of new tools. There are over 600 tools in the repo
            now. The full list of tools is <a href="tools.html">here</a>.</p>
        <br/><br/>
        <h3><a href="">Updates to Pacman.conf!</a><d>20 Dec 2013</d></h3>
        <hr>
        <p>We changed the directory structure of the repository. Please modify your
            pacman.conf files like so:
            <br /><br />
            <p id="cfont_tab">[blackarch]<br />
            Server = http://blackarch.org/blackarch/$repo/os/$arch</b></p>
            <br />
            The repository directory structure now resembles that of the official Arch
            repositories. The new structure will make it easier for mirrors to sync with
            our repository.</p>
        <br/><br/>
